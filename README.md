## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite Apps:
  Apple Notes 
  - Ability to Jot down thoughts and ideas anywhere, at anytime.
  - Ability to use hashtags to organize notes
  - Overall app structure

  Apple Calendar:
  - Abiltiy to organize days, weeks, or even years ahead
  - Amazing UI, abiltiy to colorcode different types of tasks

  Obsidian:
  - Ability to mindmap and see how ideas connect together
  - Ability to download community plugins to enchance app experience 





"MindMake" would be an app that allows the user to translate either physical or digital notes into a flowchart or mindmap. Mindmaps/flowcharts simulate how the brain naturally breaks down information and connections betwwen ideas using the concept of neural plasticity. MindMake's primary goal is to simplify paragraphs of text into a quick flowchart, allowing it to be easier to understand and digest for both college students and everyday people alike. 

  
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

Challanges Faced:

- Finding the correct buttons for "Adjusting Editor Options"
  
- Trying to understand syntax of Swift programming language
